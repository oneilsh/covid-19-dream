```
crash_course.R - hot take on R from a coding persp.

subset_and_clean.r - read data files, uses a lot of lists and lapply() to do the same thing over many tables at once

summary.Rmd - uses the skim package to show nicely-formatted data summaries (lesson learned: skim in a PITA)

random_forest_first_pass.Rmd - some feature engineering and using tidymodels for a random forest prediction (bad results, decent exposition)

random_forest_sanity_check.Rmd - making predictions with tidymodels on an easier dataset to see if things are working as expected
